# cs301-project
Patricia Dzwill and Elizabeth Finnegan are working together as Team 4 for the CS 301-101 Semantic Segmentation of Satellite Imagery project.

In Milestone 1, we created this Github repo, and connected it to a Colab Notebook. (Installed dependencies using pip commands).

Subsequently, after installing the necessary files, we installed NNI, following these intructions: https://nni.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sharings/nni_colab_support.html

The screenshot below is our NNI Web UI displayed shortly after opening it.
